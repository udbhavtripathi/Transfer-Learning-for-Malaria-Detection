# Trasnfer-Learning-for-Malaria-Detection
In this Project I have used MobileNetV2 which is a convolutional neural network 53 layers deep model for classification of images of 'Parasitized' and 'Uninfected' cells.The blog associated with this work can be access through this link: https://www.picasoanalytics.com/post/transfer-learning-for-malaria-detection
