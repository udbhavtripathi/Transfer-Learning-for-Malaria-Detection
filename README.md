# Trasnfer-Learning-for-Malaria-Detection
In this project, I have explained how to use transfer learning to improve the accuracy of malaria detection in medical images. Transfer learning involves taking a pre-trained model, in this case, the ResNet50 model, and fine-tuning it on a smaller dataset of malaria images. This approach is useful for problems with limited training data and can lead to significant improvements in accuracy.
